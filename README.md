[INSTALL & SETUP]:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. PYPI: `pip install case_utils` or https://github.com/casework/CASE-Utilities-Python/tree/Draft-autogen-classes or https://github.com/casework/CASE-Utilities-Python


[USAGE/RUN]
  - generate.py [-o:required,-s:Optional[],--output:default="templates"]
    - "-o", ontology directory or string of directories delimited by "," , required.
    - "-s", specify a class by name that has at least one property, Optional. The name must be conventional to the original vocabulary eg. observable, tool, action, etc.
    - "--output", specify a specific directory to put the stubs, Optional, default = "templates"
    - "-a" True/False whether to allow case_utils to load in uco or not. The generated object will differ depending on what is within the graph. default = False.


[Examples]


generate all uco objects from a specific ontology dir
1. `python generate.py -o ../UCO-master/ontology --output "uco-standalone"`
2. `python generate_short.py -o ../UCO-master/ontology --output "uco-standalone-short"`

generate all case objects from a specific ontology dir without loading a specific uco ontology
1. `python generate.py -o ../CASE/ontology --output "case-standalone"`
2. `python generate_short.py -o ../CASE/ontology --output "case-standalone-short"`

generate all case and uco objects from the specified ontology dirs
1. `python generate.py -o ../UCO-master/ontology,../UCO-master/ontology --output "case-uco"`
2. `python generate_short.py -o ../UCO-master/ontology,../UCO-master/ontology --output "case-uco-short"`

generate a specific case object from a specific ontology dir without loading a specific uco ontology
1. `python generate.py -o ../CASE/ontology --output "case-standalone" -s investigation:Authorization`
2. `python generate_short.py -o ../CASE/ontology --output "case-standalone-short" -s investigation:Authorization`

generate all case objects from a specific ontology dir with caseutil loading an uco ontology of its default choice.
1. `python generate.py -o ../CASE/ontology --output "case-caseutil" -a True`
2. `python generate_short.py -o ../CASE/ontology --output "case-caseutil-short" -a True`

[OUTPUT]: json-ld file with additiona @version key for what version of case and case_utils generated the file.

Folders:
1. `\uco-standalone` is generated by generate.py for a specific uco directory, version = '0.9.0'
2. `\case-standalone` same as above but for a specific case directory with uco ontology loaded
3. `\case-uco` is generated by two specified ontology directories, uco version: '0.9.0' and case version: '0.7.0'
4. `\case-caseutils` is generated by a specified case ontology directory with case_utils loading a uco ontology. (unsure of version.)


[NOTE]
1. we load the ontology ttl files directly, implying the graph is blank. The uco ontology is loaded via case_utils load_subclass_hierarchy. Because it loads the uco ontology as well, some of the uco ontology will be generated too due to it being present in the triple preprocessing.

2. in `generate.py`, there is another 'obs_prefix' commented out which uses the direct uco ontology prefixes instead of being padded with "uco-", use it you want a stand-alone uco object with its original vocabulary prefixes: eg. case uses "uco-core" while the uco ontology uses "core".

3. `generate_short.py` is the same as `generate.py` except that it does not pull superclass properties, only presents the properties of an object that has a sh:property and sh:path.
